        When not writing code, Oliver can be found being made fun of by his friends for insisting
        he can bike through new york faster than a car and for his comically large backpack which at any point
        in time might contain a combination of his laptop, bike tools, a change of clothes,the newest trader
        joe's dried fruit snack, and a notepad that has never been written in but will one day come in handy.
