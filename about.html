        Oliver is a Boston based software developer. Oliver graduated from
        Northeastern University in January 2017 and is currently seeking
        employment as an entry level software engineer in New York city. He
        is also seeking 6 roomates by the names of: Rachel, Ross, Chandler, Phoebe, Joey and Monica.
        No Kramer's need apply.

        <p>
        When not writing code, Oliver can be found being made fun of by his friends for insisting
        he can bike through Boston faster than a car and for his comically large backpack which at any point
        in time might contain a combination of his laptop, bike tools, a change of clothes, a notepad that 
        has never been written in but will one day come in handy and the newest Trader Joe's dried fruit snack.
